# PyBer Matplotlib Analysis
## Overview of the Project

For this project Pyton Pandas and Matplotlib were used to analyze and visualize the data collected by ride-sharing app *PyBer*. Understanding the use current clients make of the *PyBer* would greatly facilitate adapting to the differences and characteristics of the users. Condensing and visualizing this historical data in a report will empower the company to evaluate its current status and make informed decisions for the future.

### Purpose
Summarize and evaluate the data to make business recommendations to *PyBer* based on the data key insights. For this analysis the focus will be on differences between users from rural, suburban, and urban communities.

# Results
The data reveals great disparities when the data is grouped by the city type, this will be summarized in the table below: 
![Summary_table](https://github.com/Li11iana/PyBer-Mat/blob/main/Resources/Summary.png)

* Total Rides
Data shows that the greatest number of rides are completed in urban areas, with 1,625 completed rides, followed by suburban areas with 625 rides and lastly rural with 125 rides.

* Total Drivers
Like the Total Rides column, the highest number of drivers corresponds to urban areas with 2,405 drivers, followed by 490 suburban drivers and just 78 rural drivers on *PyBer*. With a total of 2973 drivers 3% work in rural areas, 16% in suburban and 81% in urban areas.

* Total Fares
Following the pattern described above, the fares go from highest (urban = $ 39,854.38) to lowest (rural = $ 4,327.93). In this case, the value of total fares for the suburban areas is $ 19,356.33, approximately half of the amount collected by the urban areas.

* Average Fare per ride
For the Average Fare per Ride the highest amount is $34.62 in the rural areas, suburban areas follow very closely with $30.97 as their average fare per ride and urban areas have the lowest amount with $24.53. It makes sense that in urban areas people travel shorter distances and other transportation services are more accessible.


* Average Fare per Driver
The average fare per driver in rural areas is $55.49, the highest of all 3 types evaluated. Drivers in suburban and urban areas make an average fare of $39.50 and $16.57 in that order.

# Summary
Based on the results shown above the following recommendations were established:

* Urban areas generate the highest amount of money given the high demand for rides from these densely populated areas. Keeping the platform accessible and safe to urban city drivers and users is the main income source for *PyBer*.

* Suburban areas have a potential for more profit, with only 625 rides generating $19,356.33, advertising to suburban clients as safe and easy alternative could increase the companyâ€™s success especially with increasing suburban areas.

* In Rural areas the average fare per driver is higher than the average fare per ride, indicating that a significant number of drivers do more than one service, this could indicate that there is a demand for more services like this in rural areas, however, to maintain efficiency further analysis should be performed to determine when the peaks of demand are. 

* All 3 types of area show a similarly lineal behavior as shown in the *PyBer* Fare Summary line chart, focusing in the most populated areas would provide the most significant increase in use of the *PyBer* app.
